# TofuPad

`Tofupad` is a free DIY symmetrical hitbox/leverless rhythm game controller that uses a [YD-RP2040](https://www.amazon.com/RP2040-Board-Type-C-Raspberry-Micropython/dp/B0CG9FWDDC?crid=2Z33OKLFBHHP7) Raspberry Pi Pico clone with USB-C and the [GP2040-CE](https://gp2040-ce.info/) controller firmware for it's out of the box low latency, pin remapping, and API-swapping abilities. 

Created Primarily with DJMAX and Taiko No Tatsujin in mind, but should be compatable with a galaxy of other rhythm games.
